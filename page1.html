    <center><h1>Why make this if we already have Google?</h1></center>
    <center><h3>because publishing a website on Google with the .com, .net and more costs money</h3></center>
    <center><h3>"but we have GitHub." i know, but the problem is that it wont come up in the results page when searching on Google.</h3></center>
    <center><h3>so you gotta manually go to GitHub, inside the repositories, and then click on the link, so why not use Fries-Search?</h3></center>
    <center><h3>"isnt it the same thing on Fries-Search?" Put it in a bookmark or in a 'quick access' button.</h3></center>
    <center><h3>"but we can do that with our own websites." but what if theres a website you wanna access quick insted of manually going in github?</h3></center>
    <center><h3>you must remember that the Fries-Search is made for GitHub Published websites to quick access in a eazy way.</h3></center>
